## About xBRZ

xBRZ is a high-quality pixel art scaling algorithm designed to upscale low-resolution images while preserving sharp edges and avoiding blurriness. It's particularly well-suited for:

- Pixel art from retro games
- Low-resolution sprites and icons
- Pixel-based graphics and animations

The algorithm analyzes pixel patterns and applies intelligent interpolation to create smooth, natural-looking upscaled images.
